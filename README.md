# boostdb
work-in-progress: See [RFC doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCaXGIuEtUtW3GrZ_xgCeCqZ5sXcEHSM2TlOxsTafds/edit?usp=share_link) for additional info. **boostdb contains experimental features. Some of these ideas might be moved into the [m3db repo](https://github.com/m3db/m3), as they develop further.**

Boost is built on m3db. Currently, it provides an experimental ground for evaluating some features; For now, focusing on 2 goals:

1. Provide a cost-effective database technology for the high-volume, high-dimensional time series problem space (e.g Security and Finance)

2. Provide a distributed query engine with a rich set of time-series functions on a SQL-like language front
